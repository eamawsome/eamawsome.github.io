<p class="ariana"> “Wake Up! It's time for school!”,Lili says, ”You forgot to set your buzz clock. It's almost time to go!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Ughhhhhhhhhh”</p>
<p class="ariana">I quickly get up and eat breakfast. I grab my holobag and get the sphere ready. Inside the sphere, I check my schedule.</p>

<p class="ariana">I get out of the sphere and check my all use watch. I’m not late! I run to engineering as I like to be early. Thank the Gods that someone invented the holobag. It's lightweight, and you can hold pretty much everything and it stays small! As I run to class I see my best friend, Jessica.“Jade! I got my schedule changed and we have ALL of the same classes!!!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“COOL, Race ya to class!”,I say as I race through the halls.</p>
<p class="ariana">In class, we learn about some unknown person who invented a bunch of stuff. Although the things are cool for its time they are pretty lame now. “BUZZ”, my watch beeps, reminding me it's the end of class.
</p>
<p class="ariana">The rest of the classes until lunch are a blur. In art, we start to make clay pots like people in the old times. In languages, we do a Review day in Spanish. At lunch, I sit next to Jessica and we talk about art and other things.“Jess it's almost time for history!”I say excitedly.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I hope we are not doing more geography”</p>
<p class="ariana">During history we learn about the light they had. I think it's so interesting how they first used candles then electric lights! We use little balls of light that are motion and sound activated and they give out heat. They’re made by a buch of chemical reactions. 
</p>
<p class="ariana">“I wonder what we will do during music”, Jessica says as we walk to music.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I hope we do more composing.”
</p>
<p class="ariana">When we get to class our music teacher Ms. Devu isn’t here. There is a note on the desk, It reads: I am sick. This is now a study room.-Ms.Devu.  We saw her before music so she isn't sick. It’s so weird that she is “sick”. I wonder what she is doing because she obviously is not “sick”. For the rest of the day through PE, through study room, and while I am floating back to the house I was thinking about Ms. Devu’s sudden “sickness”.  When I get to the house I get to work on my homework trying not to get distracted much on Ms.Devu’s “sickness”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Wake Up! It's time for school!”,Lili says, ”You forgot to set your buzz clock. It's almost time to go!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Okaaaaaayyyy”, I yawn.</p>
<p class="ariana">As I quickly eat breakfast I pack up my stuff. During the float in the sphere, I check my schedule. </p>

<p class="ariana">Wait. I had a study room yesterday. I should be having piano. </p>
<p class="ariana">When I get to school I go to the office.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Um excuse me? I think my schedule is wrong.” I show the robot my schedule. ”I had study room yesterday, and I have it today too.</p>
<p class="ariana">“You did not have study room yesterday. Your schedule is right.”</p>
<p class="ariana">I try to shrug it of but I just can’t. Those words I feel like I’ve heard them before. It’s so odd. As I run to math, I realize Jessica isn't here. The day is a blur as I’m lost in thought.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Wake Up! It's time for school!”,Lili says,”You forgot to set your buzz clock. It's almost time to go!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Third Time?”, I ask, “I thought I remembered to set it last night.”</p>
<p class="ariana">Then as I quickly eat breakfast and pack up my stuff I check my schedule and find out that I don’t have piano. Wait? That wasn't a dream??? Jessica isnt here either. I go to the Office “You did not have study room yesterday, your schedule is right.”,the robot says yet again.</p>
<p class="ariana">I think about all of it during school trying to shrug it of but I just can’t. The robot says this like he rehearsed it a million times.
</p>
<p class="ariana">After school I get home only to find Aaron sitting on my couch.“Hey”,he says.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Why are you at my house?”,I hiss.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Cus you looked… wierd today and yesterday at school. Also Jessica wasn't being very helpful.”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Okaaaaay. First Jessica was not here and…”,I start.</p>
<p class="ariana">“We are going to your room to talk about things.”,he says as he drags me to my room.</p>
<p class="ariana">He is soooo lucky that my mom isn't here. </p>
<p class="ariana">“So whats up?”,he asks.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Nothing.”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Come on, spit it! I know something is up!”</p>
<p class="ariana">As I tell him everything I know he tries to help me.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Don't worry I’ll help yo…”</p>

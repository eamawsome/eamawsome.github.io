<p class="miriam"> This is puzzling, why would a dairy be in the biography section?  It’s so old too.  I flip it open to the first page and look for the date.  I take a sharp breath in and then gasp, the date is Tuesday, January 20, 1863!  Questions swirl through my mind - where did this come from, and how did it get into the school library?  The ink is a bit faded but still readable, so I sit down to read it.  It seems to be an accurate vision of the future (complete with modern cars) but it was written in 1863!  As I continue reading the first few entries, something seems a bit fishy.  I close the dairy and sit back to think: among the diary entries are snatches of a story and it seems to match up with my friend Harper’s life!  The name, small details from her life.  But it’s just not possible, yet why is this happening?  Maybe it’s a prank that some kid put in the library, but what kind of a prankster would go to all the trouble, and who would be able to make such detailed (and likely) predictions about Harper’s future?  Like the fact that she grows up to be a scientist and an inventor.</p>
<p class="miriam">I hear claws scratching at the door and Brownie shoots in and jumps high onto the bed.  I quickly pull the diary away, not because I don’t trust Brownie, but because I’m terrified of anything happening to the diary.  I snuggle with Brownie and smile at the sight of her demure little face.  As confused as I am, my little doggy can always make me feel better.</p>
<p class="miriam"> My mind begins to wander back to the subject of the diary.   Is it possible that the dairy is magic?  My mom interrupts my ponderings when she comes into my room. She tells me that Harper’s mom texted to say that they'd be here for the sleepover in a half an hour.  She wants me to make my bed and tidy my room before she comes over.  When Harper comes over we begin it as a sleepover as usual but I am so confused about the dairy that I seem absent-minded.  Harper, (being my best friend) notices and asks me what's wrong.
</p>
<p class="miriam">“What's wrong Julia?  Come on, spit it!”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Nothing. I’m fine.”
<p>
<p class="miriam">“No your not!  I just know it!”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Just school stuff.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Don't you lie to me, Julia Anderson!”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Okay fine, I’ll tell you.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Finally.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“I found someone’s old diary in the library today, my mind’s been preoccupied with that.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Why did it take me so long to get this out of you?”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“You better see that for yourself.”</p>
<p class="miriam">I pull the dairy out of my desk drawer and hand it to her.  She takes the diary from me and begins to read; soon her eyebrows squinch in confusion, and she looks up at me and asks “Where did you find this?” 
</p>
<p class="miriam">When Harper asks what's wrong, I am reluctant to tell her but she pushes me to tell her.  She asks to see the diary, so I give it to her.  As she begins to read she grows confused and starts to ask me a question, but my mom bursts in to ask us if we want to watch a movie.  Harper holds the diary behind her back but says yes (she’s a sucker for popcorn.)</p>
<p class="miriam">We watch the movie, which is The Black Stallion because we both love horses.  After it’s over we go to bed.  In the morning Harper interrogates me once again about the diary and I tell her that I found it in the school library.  She seems unsatisfied with my response but doesn’t ask any further questions.  I tell her that I don't know what's going on either but I’m sure that there’s a rational explanation. “No there’s not a rational explanation.”</p>
<p class="miriam">“Okay, okay. Maybe there isn’t one.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Yeah right, maybe”
</p>
<p class="miriam">  “You know what neither of us knows anything about what's going on, but we can figure it out together.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">“Okay.”
</p>
<p class="miriam">After Harper went home I started to feel bad about what had happened, so I gave Harper a call.  She said that it was okay and that she was sorry she had snapped at me.  As she spoke a plan began to formulate in my mind.  “Meet me behind the library after school on Wednesday.” and before she could ask any questions I hung up.</p>

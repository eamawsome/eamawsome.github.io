<h1 style="font-size:200%;">Chapter 2</h1>
<p class="ariana">I wake up as my bed vibrates and makes annoying sounds. I groan but get up and see Lili; our robot trying to tell me something. “Your mom bleeped you, she wants you to finish your Christmas shopping. She also wants you to bring Nicole to do her shopping.”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Ok I’ll try,” I said.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I’ll go make breakfast,” Lili said, “and leave you to wake up Nicole”</p>
<p class="ariana">So now I have to wake up Nicole. I never knew they programmed robots to try and get the easy way. Well, I guess they are just trying to make it more humanoid. That’s why they look like humans. And talk like humans. Just WHY do they have to be so ANNOYING, I think as I go to wake up Nicole. 
As I enter her room her bed vibrates.</p>
<p class="ariana">Go away! Why can’t we just order it on amazon?”, Nicole groans.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Mom said it was to expensive.”, I lied.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Fiiiiiine.”</p>
<p class="ariana">I go eat breakfast and get the sphere ready. After Nicole finishes breakfast I help her in the sphere then click in the coordinates for the Mall. I walk up to the entran...</p>
<p class="ariana">“THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY”, I yell in the direction the snowball came in.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Is that your booooooyyyyfrieeeeend?”, Nicole whispers.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Not even a Hello? We haven’t seen each other at all since Winter break.” said someone.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Yeah and you haven’t been bleeping me either”, I say as I throw a snowball at him.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Well let's at least get together sometime.”</p>
<p class="ariana">“OK sounds cool!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Come on let's go Nicole!”, I say.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Hey I can help you with Nicole, in fact my brother is right over here!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“That would be great Aaron, Thanks!”</p>
<p class="ariana"></p>
<p class="ariana">Inside the mall Nicole marvels at every little thing. “Can I get that?”</p>
<p class="ariana">“No”, I say annoyed.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I’m bored”, Owen whines.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Why don’t we go to Orange? I know Owen likes to “test” out the games”, Aaron says excitedly.</p>
<p class="ariana">“BYE!”,Nicole says as she runs to Orange.</p>
<p class="ariana">Well I hope they don’t break anything cus’ I’m not paying for it! What would my mom like? Maybe I can give her some gift card? No! I can give her the free rooms for The Water Discus Hotel I won at school! I was trying to tell her but this is the perfect gift! As I am thinking all of this I get lost in thought and run into a pole.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I never knew you were blind!”, some jerk sneered. Jerks, I think.</p>
<p class="ariana">“I never knew you were blind!”, someone else sneered.</p>
<p class="ariana">I can’t believe some people! Well I’m going to go to Jelemart to get some earrings for some of my friends.</p>
<p class="ariana">As I finish my Christmas shopping I go to pick up Nicole. “YAY! I finally got past that level!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Time to go Nicole! Lets do your Christmas shopping. Oh and Aaron, Thanks!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“Fiiiiiiiineeeee”,Nicole says reluctantly.</p>
<p class="ariana">“No Problem!” says Aaron.</p>
<p class="ariana">So now Nicole is picking out her presents and I gotta say, I would like the presents she’s getting for her friends.</p>
<p class="ariana">“That's the last one!”, Nicole practically shouts, “Let's go play in the snow!!!”</p>
<p class="ariana">“For once I agree with you”, I say holding in my excitement, “Lets GO!"</p>
<p class="ariana">Snowballs flew past me but I continued to build my Snow Fort. I threw a snowball straight at Nicole’s face. Then one from another direction hit me.</p>
<p class="ariana">“BOYS VERSUS GIRLS”, Aaron yelled.</p>
<p class="ariana">The snowball I threw hit right in his face. I throw quickly as Nicole comes in to my Snow Fort. “ATTACK!”,Owen yells.</p>
<p class="ariana">“Not a very smart idea”,Nicole whispers as I nail him in the face. The fight raged on and I gotta say they fought hard, but we had to go. “GIRLS WIN”, I yell and throw another snowball.</p>
<p class="ariana">I take a pic of the Fort Sumter (the Snow Fort) then yell, “COME OVER GUYS LETS TAKE A PIC.”</p>
<p class="ariana">After we take the pic Nicole and I get into the sphere and we go.</p>

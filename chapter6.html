<p class="evelyn1">Dear Diary,</p>
<p class="evelynp">I’m SO glad I found you! I never thought that I would find something useful in Abigail’s Antiques. She said that the diary was magic, but nobody ever believes anything she says. My tutor, Adalynn, says that I need to practice piano a bit more. The subjects she teaches me are piano, cursive, grammer, reading, writing, singing, art, sewing, embroidery, and manners. She loved the idea of me starting a diary. Don’t tell anyone(of course you can’t but still), Alfred, my brother, has been teaching me math! And science! I wish we lived somewhere where I could just learn. I just love writing! I’m going to start writing a story about a girl in the future who can learn whatever she wants.</p>
<p class="evelynp">I yawn and stretch as my mother calls me downstairs for toast. I read Pride and Prejudice as I eat my breakfast. My mother hands my book bag to me.</p>
<p class="evelynp">“Remember Harper, I’ll pick you up at the library at 6, alright?” says Mother.</p>
<p class="evelynp">“Alright,” I respond, “I’ll finish my homework at the library. I’m almost done with my book.”
	

</p>
<p class="evelynp">“Good. If you finish it, check out another one. Also get a biography.”</p>
<p class="evelynp">“Alright”</p>
<p class="evelynp">As I walk to school I think about how much my mom depends on me. I mean, my dad died when I was little, so I never really knew him, but sometimes I catch my mom looking over his picture and crying. I get perfect grades, read books (classics and chapter books, or history), and help clean the house and cook dinner.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p class="evelynp">That’s all for today. Write in you tomorrow.</p>
<br />
<p class="evelyn1">Love,</p>
<p class="evelyn1">Ida Eileen</p>

<h1 style="font-size:300%;">The Diary</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:200%;">Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="miriam"> I yawn and stretch as as the morning light forces its way under my eyelids.  My mom pulls the comforter off me, I grab at the counterpane trying to drag it back up.  I shiver with cold as the draft from under the window floods around me.</p>
<p class="miriam">“Get up, get up! I made you toast,” my mom says.</p>
<p class="miriam">I tear myself from bed and begin to get dressed.  I tug some pants out of a drawer and pull a shirt off a hanger.  I grab my shoes as I run out of my bedroom and slide into the kitchen. I sit down at the table, and begin to wolf down my toast with honey.</p>
<p class="miriam">“Eat quickly,” says my dad, gesturing towards the clock.  I realize that we only have fifteen more minutes and begin to eat even faster. “Drink some milk,” Dad says.</p>
<p class="miriam">When I get to school I look at the schedule board immediately and see that I have history first, and run to get my stuff.  At the end of the day my dad picks me up. When I get home I flop on the couch, only for the unpleasant surprise of Brownie licking my face all over.  I retreat from the attack and run to my room.  She trots happily after me.  I lie down on my bed and succumb to the attack. She runs all over me, sniffs me and “kisses” me.<p>
<p class="miriam">When my mom comes home I ask her if I can text Harper to see if she can come tomorrow for a sleepover.</p>
<p class="miriam">	When I see Harper the next morning she is ecstatic about the biography she is reading and says I have to go to the library during break to check out a copy.  She decides to go with me, just to browse the stacks.  She leads me to the biography section, and as we look for the book, I see something interesting among the stacks.  Normally, I would share a new discovery with Harper, but this I want to keep private.  It is an old beaten up leather bound book, frayed and damaged by years of use.  I slip it into my book bag; I’ll figure out what it is later.  I would’ve liked to get picked up right after school, but my dad has a meeting and my mom can’t pick me up until four thirty.  As I walk up to the library from the six-seven building I see Harper also walking up.  I meet up with her and we decide to keep each other company until I have to go home.  Harper’s mom is single, her dad died when she was little; so she has to stay at the library until six thirty.</p>
<p class="miriam">When I get home I immediately run to my room and open the book.  On the inside cover it reads:</p>
<p class="evelyn">The Diary of Ida Eileen</p>
<p class="miriam">This is puzzling, why would a dairy be in the biography section, and it’s so old too.  I flip it open to the first page and look for the date.  I take a sharp breath in and then gasp, the date is Tuesday, January 20, 1863!  Questions swirl through my mind - where did this come from, and how did it get into the school library?  The ink is a bit faded but still readable, so I sit down to read it.  It seems to be an accurate vision of the future (complete with modern cars) but it was written in 1863!  As I continue reading the first few entries, something seems a bit fishy.  I close the dairy and sit back to think: among the diary are snaches of a story and it seems to match up with my friend Harper’s life!  The name, small details from her life.  But it’s just not possible, yet why is this happening?  Maybe it’s a prank that some kid put in the library, but what kind of a prankster would go to all the trouble, and who would be able to make such detailed (and likely) predictions about Harper’s future?  Like the fact that she grows up to be a scientist and an inventor.  I hear claws scratching at the door and Brownie shoots in and jumps high onto the bed.  I quickly pull the diary away, not because I don’t trust Brownie, but because I’m terrified of anything happening to the diary.  I snuggle with Brownie and smile at the sight of her demure little face.  As confused as I am, my little doggy can always make me feel better.  My mind begins to wander back to the subject of the diary.   Is it possible that the dairy is magic?  My mom interrupts my ponderings when she comes into my room. She tells me that Harper’s mom texted to say that they'd be here for the sleepover in a half an hour.  She wants me to make my bed and tidy my room before she comes over.</p>

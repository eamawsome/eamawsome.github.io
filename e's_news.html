<h1>Birthday Trouble</h1>
<p>Today is the day before my little sisters birthday. Tomorrow my Dad has to go on a work trip. He is going to miss her birthday. Tonight we're going out to dinner to celebrate. AND opening presents. I got to spend my last birthday in the car returning home from a road trip. 12 hours in the car with my little sister and mom and dad. Yay.</p>
<h1>Elephants and Mozart</h1>
<p>I was just reading <em>The New York Times's</em> magazine <em>Upfront</em> and I stumbled upon an interesting article(if your interested in the article, click this link:<a href="https://upfront.scholastic.com/issues/2018-19/031119/these-elephants-love-beethoven.html" target="_blank" >Article</a>). It was about a man, Paul Barton, who played piano. One day, he was playing the piano in an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, when he noticed an elephant had gone quiet and seemed to be listening to him. He moved the piano into a heard of handicapped, old, and injured elephants. They swayed to the rythem. Is it possible that classical music can helpelephants relax? Could it be the same for other animals? Is it the same for humans?</p>
<p>Last thing. I have one riddle for you. Five men are going to church. None of them have an umbrella or raincoats or hoods. Yet one of them does not get wet. The other men are not sheilding him in any way. How is this possible?</p>

<h1>E gets cough, annoys M</h1>
<p>Our beloved editor, E, has recently cought a cold. The symptoms she shows are a cough, zero hunger, and sleepiness. At work she is often heard coughing which greatly annoys her co-worker and subject. "Evil. Sneezes can travel up to a meter, man. And coughs can travel up to two thirds of a meter, man." She said this while covering her mouth and nose with her hand. She belives that germs, when coming from a cough can be especially dangerous. She then proceded to sneeze. Twice. Hypocrite.</p>
<h1>Mirm is a Rat</h1>
<p>Earlier today Mirm randomly said somithing rather suprising. "I am a rat!", she said out of the blue. "You can quote that." she then said to her very suprised editor. Is she not Mirm the worm anymore? Is she now.. Mirm the Rat???!!??!!!??? More next time.</p>
<h1>E's Favorite Words</h1>
<p> Our beloved editors favorite words are 'therefore' and 'whereas' and 'whatsoever'.</p>
